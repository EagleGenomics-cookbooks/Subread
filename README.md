# Subread

Cookbook for installing the Subread package: high-performance read alignment, quantification and mutation discovery

Description
===========

The Subread package comprises a suite of software programs for processing next-gen sequencing read data including:

Subread: an accurate and efficient aligner for mapping both genomic DNA-seq reads and RNA-seq reads (for the purpose of expression analysis).
Subjunc: an RNA-seq aligner suitable for all purposes of RNA-seq analyses.
featureCounts: a highly efficient and accurate read summarization program.
exactSNP: a SNP caller that discovers SNPs by testing signals against local background noises.
These programs were also implemented in Bioconductor R package Rsubread.
